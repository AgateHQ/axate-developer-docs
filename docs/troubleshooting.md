### Third Party Cookies

Axate relies on two cookies, one functional and one for analytics purposes, which will be set during the account creation or login.

Users can opt-out of analytics cookies on their account page, or even block it by any AdBlocker or Tracking Blocking software on their browser, but they should allow the main functional cookie to be set.

That cookie is named `agate_cookie`, and comes from `https://account.agate.io` , it is an HttpOnly cookie and always Secure to prevent any other site using it for any potentially malicous purposes.
