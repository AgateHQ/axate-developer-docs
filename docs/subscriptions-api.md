### How you incorporate your subscribers

If you have a subscription model which includes website access as a benefit, there are various ways of implementing Axate to complement your existing offer.

One way is to implement Axate so that it is not displayed to your logged-in subscribers. Once a subscriber is logged in, Axate is not displayed.

Another way is to leave Axate visible but display a price of “Free” to a logged in subscriber, reminding them of the benefit they get by being a subscriber.

If your subscription set up does not include a logged in state (for example it’s for a print product), and you wish to give your subscribers free access to premium content we can set up an API. We will discuss this with you prior to the start of the implementation.
